# PinyinPal: A Modern Mandarin Learning App üá®üá≥

**Repository:** `mandarin-vite-react-ts`

PinyinPal is an interactive web application designed to help new learners master the fundamentals of Mandarin Chinese, with a specific focus on pinyin, tones, and character recognition. This project is built using modern web technologies to create a fast, responsive, and engaging learning experience.

## ‚ú® Key Features

- **Interactive Flashcards:** Practice associating pinyin with characters and English definitions.
- **Tonal Practice Drills:** Strengthen your understanding of the four Mandarin tones through targeted exercises.
- **Spaced Repetition Algorithm:** Optimize your learning with an intelligent system that reviews challenging words more frequently.
- **Progress Tracking:** Monitor your learning journey and celebrate your milestones.

## üõ†Ô∏è Tech Stack

- **Frontend:** **React** with **TypeScript**
- **Build Tool:** **Vite**
- **State Management:** (Your choice here, e.g., Zustand, Redux, or React Context)
- **Styling:** (Your choice here, e.g., Tailwind CSS, Styled-components, or pure CSS)

## üó∫Ô∏è Future Vision & Roadmap

This project is more than just a Mandarin learning tool; it's designed with scalability and future growth in mind.

- **Polyglot Expansion:** The core architecture is being built to easily support the addition of other languages, allowing PinyinPal to become a multi-language learning platform.
- **Micro-Frontend Conversion:** We plan to explore converting the application into a micro-frontend architecture. This would allow different features (e.g., flashcards, tone drills) to be developed and deployed independently, making the project more robust and maintainable for a larger community.
