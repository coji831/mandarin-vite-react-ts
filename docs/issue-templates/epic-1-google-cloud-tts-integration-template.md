## Title

Implement Google Cloud Text-to-Speech Integration for Mandarin Vocabulary Learning

## Description

We need to integrate Google Cloud's Text-to-Speech API to provide high-quality audio pronunciation for Mandarin vocabulary in our application. This will enhance the user experience by providing accurate native pronunciation for vocabulary words and example sentences.

### Goals

- Integrate with Google Cloud Text-to-Speech API for natural-sounding Mandarin pronunciation
- Implement a caching strategy using Google Cloud Storage to optimize performance and reduce API costs
- Provide a seamless audio playback experience in the vocabulary learning flow
- Ensure the integration works with our existing FlashCard and PlayButton components

### Related to

This issue is related to Epic 2 (Integrate New Vocabulary Learning User Flow into Existing System) and serves as a key enhancement to the vocabulary learning experience. The TTS functionality will be a critical component of the new vocabulary learning flow.

### Technical Requirements

- Set up Google Cloud project with Text-to-Speech and Storage APIs
- Create a local Express server for development testing
- Implement caching logic to store generated audio files
- Update frontend components to interact with the TTS API
- Ensure proper error handling for API failures
- Document the implementation details thoroughly

### Acceptance Criteria

- [ ] Users can hear accurate Mandarin pronunciation for vocabulary items
- [ ] Audio playback works reliably with appropriate loading states
- [ ] Audio files are cached to prevent redundant API calls
- [ ] Implementation is well-documented for future developers
- [ ] Local development environment is properly configured
- [ ] Solution is scalable for production deployment
