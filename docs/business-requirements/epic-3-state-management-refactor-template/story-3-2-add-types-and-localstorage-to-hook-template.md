## Background

Type safety and persistence are critical for maintainability and reliability. The hook should encapsulate all localStorage logic and use strict types to prevent runtime errors.

## Business Rationale

- Improves reliability and maintainability
- Prevents type-related bugs
- Centralizes persistence logic

## Acceptance Criteria

- All state and functions in the hook have TypeScript types
- All localStorage operations are handled inside the hook
- No localStorage logic remains in the main component
