# Story 5.3: Search and Filtering Functionality

## Description

**As a** language learner,
**I want to** search and filter vocabulary lists by name, difficulty, or tags,
**So that** I can quickly find lists that match my learning goals.

## Business Value

Saves users time and effort by enabling quick discovery of relevant vocabulary lists. Increases user satisfaction and retention by making the selection process efficient and tailored to individual needs.

## Acceptance Criteria

- [x] A search box is prominently displayed at the top of the vocabulary list page
- [x] Users can search by list name and description text
- [x] Filter options are available for difficulty levels (beginner, intermediate, advanced)
- [x] Filter options are available for tags/categories
- [x] Search results update in real-time as the user types
- [x] Filters can be combined with search terms for refined results
- [x] Empty search results display an appropriate message and suggestions
- [x] Search and filter state is preserved during the session
- [x] Clear indicators show which filters are currently active
- [x] A "clear all" option resets all search and filter criteria
- [x] Search is case-insensitive and accent-insensitive

## Business Rules

1. Search should match partial words (not just beginning of words)
2. Multiple selected filters in the same category should use OR logic (e.g., selecting both "beginner" and "intermediate" shows both)
3. Filters from different categories should use AND logic (e.g., "beginner" difficulty AND "HSK3" tag)
4. Recently used filters should be easily accessible
5. Search history is not stored between sessions for privacy

## Technical Considerations

## Implementation Status

Status: Completed

- Search functionality should use debouncing to prevent performance issues during typing
- Filter state should be reflected in the component state but not in the URL for this version
- Consider implementing fuzzy search for better matching of similar terms
- Performance optimization may be needed if the number of vocabulary lists becomes very large
- Filter implementation should allow for easy addition of new filter categories in the future

## Test Cases

1. **Search Functionality:**

   - Partial word matches return appropriate results
   - Non-matching searches show empty state correctly
   - Special characters and non-Latin scripts are handled properly

2. **Filter Functionality:**

   - Multiple filters work correctly with the defined logic
   - Filters update the displayed results immediately
   - Filter counts accurately reflect the number of items in each category

3. **Combined Usage:**
   - Search and filters work correctly when used together
   - Clearing filters while maintaining search terms works as expected
   - Performance remains acceptable with complex filter combinations

## User Experience

The search and filter functionality transforms the vocabulary list selection from a browsing experience to a targeted selection process. Users with specific learning goals can quickly find relevant content without scanning through the entire collection.

The real-time updates provide immediate feedback, helping users refine their criteria until they find exactly what they're looking for. The combination of text search and categorical filters accommodates different user preferences for finding content.

This feature is particularly valuable for returning users who know what type of content they want to study but may not remember specific list names or for users with specific requirements regarding difficulty level or content topics.
