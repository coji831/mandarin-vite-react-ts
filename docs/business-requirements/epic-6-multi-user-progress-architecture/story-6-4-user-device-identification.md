# Story 6.4: User/Device Identification Infrastructure

## Description

**As a** user,
**I want my progress to be associated with my device/account,
So that** my learning history is preserved.

## Acceptance Criteria

- [x] User/device identification is implemented for progress association (see ProgressStore, useUserIdentity, UserIdentityProvider)
- [x] Progress data is stored and retrieved per user/device (see ProgressStore CRUD)
- [x] Context provider supplies user/device identity throughout the app (UserIdentityProvider integrated at root)
- [ ] Switching users/devices loads the correct progress (UI for switching not yet implemented)
- [ ] UI provides a way to identify or switch users/devices (not yet implemented)
- [ ] Tests verify correct association and retrieval (pending)

## Business Rules

- User/device IDs must be unique and persistent
- No user data should be overwritten without confirmation

## Implementation Status

Status: In Progress

User/device identification infrastructure is implemented in code:

- Unique user/device ID is generated and persisted (ProgressStore)
- Progress CRUD utilities use user/device ID
- UserIdentityProvider context supplies identity to the app
- App is wrapped in UserIdentityProvider

UI for switching users/devices and tests are not yet implemented.
