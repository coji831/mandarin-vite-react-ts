# Story 6.2: Provider Separation and Context Refactoring

## Description

**As a** developer,
**I want to** separate VocabularyProvider from ProgressProvider,
**So that** they can operate independently while still working together.

## Acceptance Criteria

- [ ] VocabularyProvider and ProgressProvider are implemented as separate context providers
- [ ] Each provider manages its own state and logic
- [ ] Components can consume either or both providers as needed
- [ ] Refactored architecture maintains all existing functionality
- [ ] Unit tests verify provider separation and integration

## Business Rules

- Providers must not introduce circular dependencies
- State updates in one provider should not cause unnecessary re-renders in the other

## Implementation Status

Status: Planned
