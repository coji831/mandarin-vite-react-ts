# Story 6.3: Component Adaptation to New Architecture

## Description

**As a** developer,
**I want to** refactor existing components to use the new providers,
**So that** they maintain functionality while leveraging the new architecture.

## Acceptance Criteria

- [ ] All components that use progress or vocabulary data are updated to use the new providers
- [ ] No component directly accesses both vocab and progress state without using the providers
- [ ] All user flows (study, review, progress display) work as before
- [ ] Unit/integration tests verify component adaptation

## Business Rules

- Refactoring must not break existing user flows
- All state must be accessed via the appropriate provider

## Implementation Status

Status: Planned
