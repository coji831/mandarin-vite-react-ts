# Story 6.3: Component Adaptation to New Architecture

## Description

**As a** developer,
**I want to** refactor existing components to use the new providers,
**So that** they maintain functionality while leveraging the new architecture.

## Implementation Status

Status: Completed

## Acceptance Criteria

- [x] All components that use progress or vocabulary data are updated to use the new providers
- [x] No component directly accesses both vocab and progress state without using the providers
- [x] All user flows (study, review, progress display) work as before
- [x] Code reviewed and documented per project guides

## Business Rules

- Refactoring must not break existing user flows
- All state must be accessed via the appropriate provider
