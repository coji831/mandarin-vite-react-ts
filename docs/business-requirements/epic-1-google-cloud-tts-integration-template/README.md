# Epic 1: Google Cloud Text-to-Speech Integration

## Epic Summary

**Goal:** Integrate Google Cloud's Text-to-Speech API to provide high-quality audio pronunciation for Mandarin vocabulary in our application.

**Status:** Completed

**Last Update:** July 6, 2025

## Background

We need to enhance the user experience in our Mandarin vocabulary learning application by providing accurate native pronunciation. Currently, users can only see the vocabulary words but cannot hear how they should be pronounced, which limits their learning effectiveness.

Google Cloud's Text-to-Speech API offers high-quality Mandarin voices that can accurately pronounce vocabulary words and example sentences. This functionality is related to Epic 2 (Vocabulary Learning Flow) and serves as a key enhancement to the vocabulary learning experience.

## User Story

**As a** language learner,
**I want to** hear accurate Mandarin pronunciation for vocabulary words,
**So that** I can improve my speaking skills and learn correct pronunciation.

## Business Value

This integration provides significant value by:

- Improving learning outcomes through auditory reinforcement
- Increasing user engagement by providing a more complete learning experience
- Differentiating our application from competitors with high-quality audio
- Supporting diverse learning styles (visual and auditory)

## Acceptance Criteria

- [ ] Users can hear accurate Mandarin pronunciation for vocabulary items
- [ ] Audio playback works reliably with appropriate loading states
- [ ] Audio files are cached to prevent redundant API calls
- [ ] Implementation is well-documented for future developers
- [ ] Local development environment is properly configured
- [ ] Solution is scalable for production deployment

## Implementation Plan

1. Set up Google Cloud project with Text-to-Speech and Storage APIs
2. Create a local Express server for development testing
3. Implement caching logic to store generated audio files
4. Update frontend components to interact with the TTS API
5. Ensure proper error handling for API failures
6. Document the implementation details thoroughly

## Implementation Status

- **Status**: Completed
- **PR**: #1
- **Key Milestones**:
  - Google Cloud API integration (July 2, 2025)
  - Caching implementation (July 4, 2025)
  - Frontend integration (July 6, 2025)
