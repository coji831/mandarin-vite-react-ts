# Story 7.14: Update docs and references for removed flow

## Description

**As a** technical writer,
**I want to** update docs and references so there are no references to the legacy daily-commitment flow,
**So that** documentation remains accurate and developers/QA are not confused by obsolete instructions.

## Business Value

Accurate docs reduce onboarding friction and prevent mistaken reliance on removed features.

## Acceptance Criteria

- [ ] All documentation references to the daily-commitment and section flows are removed or updated.
- [ ] README, guides, and templates reflect the new list-first flow where applicable.

## Business Rules

1. Changes to docs should be linked to PRs and include review by a technical writer.
