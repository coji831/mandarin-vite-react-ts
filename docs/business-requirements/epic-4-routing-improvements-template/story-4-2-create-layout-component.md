# Story 4.2: Create Layout Component with Outlet

## Description

**As a** developer,
**I want to** create a layout component with an outlet for the Mandarin feature to maintain consistent UI elements across all subpages,
**So that** the UI is consistent and code duplication is reduced.

## Business Value

Provides a single place for shared UI elements, improving maintainability and user experience.

## Acceptance Criteria

- [x] Create a new layout file `MandarinLayout.tsx` in `src/features/mandarin/layouts/`
- [x] Implement a layout component that includes the `MandarinProvider` and common UI elements
- [x] Use React Router's `Outlet` component to render nested routes
- [x] Update the router configuration to use this layout
- [ ] `MandarinLayout` component is created with common UI elements
- [ ] The layout uses React Router's `Outlet` component for nested routes
- [ ] The layout wraps all content with `MandarinProvider` for context access
- [ ] The router configuration is updated to use the layout
- [ ] UI elements are consistent across all subpages
- [ ] The layout is documented with JSDoc comments
- [ ] Unit tests are created for the layout
- [ ] All functionality works identically after refactoring

## Business Rules

1. All old Mandarin feature components must be moved into the `/pages` directory and converted into standalone subpages of the `/mandarin` routes, following the new nested routing structure.
2. The layout must wrap all Mandarin subpages and provide shared UI elements.
