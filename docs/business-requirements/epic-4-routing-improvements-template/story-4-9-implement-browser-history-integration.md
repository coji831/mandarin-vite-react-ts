# Story 4.9: Implement Browser History Integration

## Description

**As a** developer,
**I want to** implement proper browser history integration for improved navigation experience,
**So that** users can use the browser back/forward buttons and always see the correct Mandarin subpage.

## Business Value

Ensures a robust navigation experience and prevents user confusion by handling browser history and invalid navigation cases.

## Acceptance Criteria

- [x] Ensure browser back and forward buttons navigate correctly between routes
- [x] Add appropriate page titles for each route
- [x] Handle navigation when state is missing or invalid
- [x] Add route guards to prevent invalid navigation paths
- [x] Implement navigation confirmation for unsaved changes if applicable
- [x] Document browser history integration
- [x] Create tests for browser navigation scenarios
- [x] Verify all browser history features work correctly

## Business Rules

1. All old Mandarin feature components must be moved into the `/pages` directory and converted into standalone subpages of the `/mandarin` routes, following the new nested routing structure.
2. Route guards and browser history handling must be implemented for all Mandarin subpages.
