# Business Requirements Format Guide

## Overview

This document provides standardized templates for business requirements documentation.

> **KEY POINTS**:
>
> - **Business focus**: Captures user needs and business context
> - **Technical separation**: Technical details belong in Implementation Format
> - **Audience**: Optimized for stakeholders and business teams

## Document Focus

The Business Requirements documents should:

1. **Prioritize business context** - Focus on user needs, business value, and stakeholder requirements
2. **Include minimal technical context** - Brief technical context is permitted when needed to explain business decisions
3. **Maintain tracking information** - Include implementation status, timelines, and key milestone commits
4. **Explain the "why"** - Focus on the reasons for features rather than implementation details

## Epic Documentation Guidelines

All epics now use a single unified template for business requirements, regardless of size or number of stories.

**Key points:**

1. **Single template for all epics** – Use the canonical epic business requirements template for every epic.
2. **Epic and story structure** – Place the epic overview in a README.md and create separate files for each story as needed.
3. **Story breakdown** – Clearly explain how and why the epic is divided into stories, and maintain cross-references between epic and story docs.
4. **Consistent terminology** – Use the same terms and concepts across all documents.
5. **Acceptance criteria** – Write acceptance criteria as a checklist in the epic, and map each item to stories or test cases as appropriate.
