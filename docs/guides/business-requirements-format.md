# Business Requirements Format Guide

## Overview

This document provides standardized templates for business requirements documentation.

> **KEY POINTS**:
>
> - **Business focus**: Captures user needs and business context
> - **Technical separation**: Technical details belong in Implementation Format
> - **Audience**: Optimized for stakeholders and business teams

## Document Focus

The Business Requirements documents should:

1. **Prioritize business context** - Focus on user needs, business value, and stakeholder requirements
2. **Include minimal technical context** - Brief technical context is permitted when needed to explain business decisions
3. **Maintain tracking information** - Include implementation status, timelines, and key milestone commits
4. **Explain the "why"** - Focus on the reasons for features rather than implementation details

## Epic Size Guidelines

### For Small Epics (1-2 stories)

1. **Single document approach** - Document epic and story details in one README.md
2. **Simplified structure** - Use abbreviated template focusing on core sections
3. **Consolidated criteria** - Combine epic and story acceptance criteria

### For Large Epics (3+ stories)

1. **Split documentation** - Use README.md for epic overview and separate files for stories
2. **Clear story divisions** - Explain how and why the epic breaks into distinct stories
3. **Cross-references** - Link related stories and maintain relationship documentation
4. **Delegated details** - Keep epic concise, put specifics in story documents
5. **Consistent terminology** - Use same terms and concepts across all documents
