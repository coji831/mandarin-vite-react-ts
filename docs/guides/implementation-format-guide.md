# Issue Implementation Format Guide

## Overview

This document provides standardized templates for technical implementation documentation.

> **KEY POINTS**:
>
> - **Technical focus**: Captures implementation details, patterns, and architecture
> - **AI optimization**: Structured for maximum AI comprehension and assistance
> - **Audience**: Developers and AI coding agents

## Document Focus

The Technical Implementation documents should:

1. **Prioritize technical details** - Focus on patterns, architecture, and implementation
2. **Include practical code examples** - Provide representative code patterns
3. **Explain technical decisions** - Document why certain technical choices were made
4. **Document relationships** - Clarify how components interact with each other
5. **Support AI assistance** - Structure documentation to optimize for AI comprehension

## Epic Size Guidelines

### For Small Epics (1-2 stories)

1. **Consolidated document** - Use a single README.md with comprehensive technical details
2. **Direct code patterns** - Include implementation patterns directly in the epic document
3. **Simplified architecture** - Focus on integration with existing systems rather than complex architecture
4. **Streamlined sections** - Use only the most relevant sections for small implementations

### For Large Epics (3+ stories)

1. **Split documentation** - Use README.md for epic overview and separate files for stories
2. **High-level overview** - Keep the epic README focused on system-wide patterns and decisions
3. **Component diagrams** - Include relationship diagrams showing major subsystems
4. **Cross-cutting concerns** - Document authentication, logging, error handling at epic level
5. **Implementation index** - Include links to detailed story implementation documents
