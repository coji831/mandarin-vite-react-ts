# Story 2-6: Manage Tracking Data in localStorage

Part of [Epic 2: Vocabulary Learning Flow](../epic-2-vocabulary-learning-flow.md)

## Description

As a language learner, I want my learning progress to be saved between sessions, so that I don't lose track of which words I've studied and how well I know them.

## Acceptance Criteria

- System tracks which words the user has studied
- System records user's familiarity rating for each word
- Progress data persists between browser sessions using localStorage
- Words are linked to their tracking data via wordId

## Implementation Notes

- Created data structure to separate static word data from dynamic tracking data
- Implemented localStorage saving and loading functions
- Added wordId-based linking between data sets
- Created progress tracking metrics
- Ensured performance optimization for large datasets

## Status

Completed
