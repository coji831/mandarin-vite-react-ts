# Implementation: Story 6.5 â€“ Migrate Progress Logic to Per-User ProgressStore (Final Integration and Completion)

## Story Summary

Migrate all remaining progress logic, hooks, and state to use the new per-user ProgressStore, fully adopting the new architecture, removing all legacy logic, and preparing the system for future multi-user and sync features. This story replaces the old sync story as the final integration and completion step for Epic 6.

## Technical Tasks

- Migrate all progress logic, hooks, and state to use the new per-user ProgressStore API
- Ensure the current user/device ID (from `useUserIdentity`) is always used for progress operations
- Remove all legacy and single-user localStorage logic from the app
- Test persistence and correct association for per-user progress
- Review and update all related documentation per project guides
- Ensure the system is ready for future multi-user and sync features

## Data Model/Types

- UserProgress, UserIdentity (from ProgressStore)

## Edge Cases

- Migration of existing progress data
- Switching users/devices

## Testing

- Unit: ProgressStore integration, CRUD
- Manual: Progress persists per user/device, no data loss

- The current user/device ID (from `useUserIdentity`) is always used for progress operations.
- All legacy and single-user localStorage logic has been fully removed from the app.
- Progress persists correctly per user/device across reloads and logins.
- Code and documentation have been reviewed and updated per project guides.
- Manual and unit tests verify correct per-user persistence and isolation.
- The system is ready for future multi-user and sync features.

## Implementation Details

- All progress CRUD in `useMandarinProgress.ts` and related files now uses the per-user ProgressStore API.
- The current user/device ID (from `useUserIdentity`) is always used for progress operations.
- Old single-user localStorage keys have been fully removed from the main app logic.
- Progress persists correctly per user/device across reloads and logins.
- Code and documentation have been reviewed and updated per project guides.

### Testing

- Unit: ProgressStore integration, CRUD
- Manual: Progress persists per user/device, no data loss, user switching verified
