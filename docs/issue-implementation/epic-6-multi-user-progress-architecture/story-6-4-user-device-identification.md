# Implementation: Story 6.4 â€“ User/Device Identification Infrastructure

## Story Summary

Implement user/device identification for associating progress, with a UI foundation that currently supports a single user but is designed for easy extension to multiple users in the future.

## Technical Tasks

- [x] Implement unique user/device ID generation and storage (ProgressStore)
- [x] Update progress CRUD utilities to use user/device ID (ProgressStore)
- [x] Add UserIdentityProvider context and integrate at app root
- [ ] Test association and retrieval logic (pending)

## Data Model/Types

- User/device ID, progress association

## Edge Cases

- Duplicate IDs
- User/device switching

## Testing

## Completion Summary

- User/device identification and context provider integration are complete.
- The UI currently displays the user/device identity but does not allow switching (per current requirements).
