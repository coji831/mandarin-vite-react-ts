# Implementation: Story 6.6 â€“ Migrate Progress Logic to Per-User ProgressStore

## Story Summary

Refactor the main progress hook (`useMandarinProgress.ts`) and related logic to use the new per-user ProgressStore, ensuring all progress is reliably associated with the correct user/device and persists as designed.

## Technical Tasks

- Refactor all progress CRUD in `useMandarinProgress.ts` to use ProgressStore API
- Inject/use current user/device ID for all progress operations
- Remove all usage of the old single-user localStorage key from app logic
- Test persistence and correct association for multiple users/devices
- Review and document changes per project guides

## Data Model/Types

- UserProgress, UserIdentity (from ProgressStore)

## Edge Cases

- Migration of existing progress data
- Switching users/devices

## Testing

- Unit: ProgressStore integration, CRUD
- Manual: Progress persists per user/device, no data loss

## Status

Completed (2025-10-03)

## Implementation Details

- All progress CRUD in `useMandarinProgress.ts` and related files now uses the per-user ProgressStore API.
- The current user/device ID (from `useUserIdentity`) is always used for progress operations.
- Old single-user localStorage keys have been fully removed from the main app logic.
- Progress persists correctly per user/device across reloads and logins.
- Code and documentation have been reviewed and updated per project guides.

### Testing

- Unit: ProgressStore integration, CRUD
- Manual: Progress persists per user/device, no data loss, user switching verified
