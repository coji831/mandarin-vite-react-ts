# Story 3-2: Add TypeScript Types and LocalStorage Handling to Hook

## Story Summary

Add proper TypeScript types to all state and functions in `useMandarinProgress`. Ensure all localStorage operations are handled within the hook.

## Background

Type safety and persistence are critical for maintainability and reliability. The hook should encapsulate all localStorage logic and use strict types.

## Acceptance Criteria

- All state and functions in the hook have TypeScript types
- All localStorage operations are handled inside the hook
- No localStorage logic remains in `Mandarin.tsx`

# Implementation Plan & Notes

1. Added and refactored TypeScript types for progress state to `Progress.ts`.
2. Updated all imports to use the barrel file for types.
3. Centralized all localStorage logic in `useMandarinProgress` hook.
4. Updated `Mandarin.tsx` to use the hook and helpers for all progress management.
5. No localStorage logic remains in `Mandarin.tsx`.
