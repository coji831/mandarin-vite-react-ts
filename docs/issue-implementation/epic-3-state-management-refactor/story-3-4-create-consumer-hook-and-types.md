# Story 3-4: Create Consumer Hook and Add Types

## Story Summary

Create a custom hook for consuming the Mandarin context and ensure all context values are properly typed.

## Background

A consumer hook simplifies context usage and enforces type safety for all consumers.

## Acceptance Criteria

- A custom hook (e.g., `useMandarin`) is created for consuming context
- All context values are strictly typed
- Components use the consumer hook for accessing state/actions

# Implementation Plan & Notes

1. Created `useMandarinContext.ts` in `src/features/mandarin/context/`
2. Implemented the hook to consume Mandarin context using `useProgressContext`
3. Next: Refactor one component (e.g., `VocabularyListSelector`) to use the new hook
4. Update types as needed for context values
5. Document usage in feature docs
