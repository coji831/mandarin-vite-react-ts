# Story 3-3: Create Context and Provider

## Story Summary

Create a React context and provider component to share the state and actions from `useMandarinProgress` across the Mandarin feature.

## Background

Using context allows components to access state and actions without prop drilling, improving maintainability and scalability.

## Acceptance Criteria

- A context is created for Mandarin state
- A provider component wraps the hook and provides state/actions to children
- No prop drilling for progress state/actions
