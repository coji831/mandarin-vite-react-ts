# Implementation 3-10: Sidebar Context Refactor

## Technical Scope ðŸ”µ

Refactor the `Sidebar` component to consume Mandarin progress context directly, removing all progress-related props. Sidebar now interacts with centralized state via the consumer hook, improving maintainability and reducing interface complexity.

## Implementation Details ðŸ”µ

```tsx
// Sidebar.tsx (excerpt)
import { useProgressContext } from "../features/mandarin/ProgressContext";

const Sidebar = () => {
  const { progress, setProgress } = useProgressContext();
  // ...existing code...
};
```

- All progress-related props have been removed from Sidebar.
- Sidebar now accesses progress state and actions via context.
- Type definitions for progress are imported from the shared barrel file.

## Architecture Integration ðŸ”µ

```
[Sidebar] â†’ uses â†’ [ProgressContext]
         â†“ provides
[Mandarin Feature Components]
```

- Sidebar is now decoupled from parent components and directly consumes context.
- Integrates with the broader state management refactor (Epic 3).

## Technical Challenges & Solutions ðŸ”µ

**Problem:** Prop drilling made Sidebar interface complex and tightly coupled to parent components.

**Solution:** Refactored Sidebar to use the consumer hook (`useProgressContext`), eliminating prop drilling and simplifying the interface. Ensured type safety by importing shared types.

**Problem:** Test setup required manual prop mocks.

**Solution:** Updated tests to use context provider wrapper for Sidebar.

## Testing Implementation ðŸŸ¡

- Verified Sidebar functionality remains unchanged after refactor.
- Updated unit tests to wrap Sidebar in ProgressContext provider.
- Checked edge cases for context updates and re-renders.
