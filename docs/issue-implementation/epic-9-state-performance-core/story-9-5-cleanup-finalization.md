# Implementation 9-5: Cleanup & Finalization

## Technical Scope

Finalize cleanup after all consumer migrations. Deprecate/remove legacy types and compatibility shims, and prepare release notes that document reset behavior.

Deliverables:

Deliverables:

- Remove legacy `src/features/mandarin/types/Progress.ts` (deleted from workspace)
- Remove legacy `ProgressContext` API (compat shim removed from `ProgressContext.tsx`)
- Update docs and changelog with reset/migration notes

## Implementation Details

2. Remove legacy types directly (deleted `src/features/mandarin/types/Progress.ts`).
3. Remove compatibility shims and update imports across the repo (removed `useProgressContext` shim).
4. Confirm no consumers rely on legacy API (use code search and PR reviews).
5. Move legacy types to `types/legacy/` with comments and deprecation guidance.

- Removed legacy `src/features/mandarin/types/Progress.ts` (deleted in workspace).
- Removed legacy `ProgressContext` export (compat shim deleted; consumers should use `useProgressState` and `useProgressDispatch`).

### Files to update / deprecate

PR verification (copy into PR description):

- [x] Legacy types removed from `src/features/mandarin/types/Progress.ts` (deleted)
- [x] Legacy `ProgressContext` shim removed and replacements documented
- [ ] Release notes include reset/migration impact and rollback instructions
- Update `src/router/Router.tsx` wiring if necessary and finalize release notes documenting reset behavior.
- Add a short PR checklist confirming consumer smoke checks and rollback plan.

### Missing scope (source scan) â€” story 9.5

Files relevant to PR 9.5 (include or reference in PR):

- `src/features/mandarin/types/Progress.ts` -> moved to `src/features/mandarin/types/legacy/Progress.ts` (deprecation)
- Removal of legacy `ProgressContext` export (after consumer migration)
- Finalized release notes and changelog entries documenting reset behavior
- `src/router/Router.tsx` (verify final wiring)

PR verification (copy into PR description):

- [ ] Legacy types moved to `types/legacy/` with deprecation notes
- [ ] Legacy `ProgressContext` export removed and replacements documented
- [ ] Release notes include reset/migration impact and rollback instructions

## Architecture Integration

- Ensure final API surface (`useProgressState`, `useProgressActions`) is documented and exported from the internal hooks package.

## Technical Challenges & Solutions

Problem: accidental removal of types or APIs still used by small/old branches.

Solution: include a deprecation window and communicate clearly on PRs and release notes; prefer moving to `types/legacy/` first.

- Validate consumer behavior via manual verification steps and small smoke checks as part of PR review and staging validation. Add a short checklist to PR descriptions documenting which flows were verified.
