# Story 7.6 Implementation: Open flashcards directly after list selection

## Technical Rationale

Update navigation so selecting a vocabulary list immediately opens the flashcard deck for that list.

## Implementation Steps

2. Remove daily commitment UI from flow
3. Add loading state to FlashCardPage

## Key Decisions

- Remove all daily commitment logic

## Risks & Mitigations

- Risk: Navigation bugs â€” Mitigation: test back-button and edge cases
