# Implementation 4-5: Convert Flashcard Page with Parameters

## Technical Scope

Convert the flashcard subpage to a dedicated route component (`FlashCardPage.tsx`) that uses route parameters for dynamic data. The new page is implemented in `/pages` and integrated into the `/mandarin` routes. The FlashCardPage uses the `useParams` hook to extract the `sectionId` parameter and the `useMandarin` (ProgressContext) for state. Navigation is now route-based, not state-based. JSDoc comments are included. The barrel file exports the new page using `export * from './FlashCardPage'` for consistency.

## Implementation Details

- `FlashCardPage.tsx` is implemented as a standalone route component in `/pages`.
- The component uses the `useParams` hook to extract the `sectionId` parameter and the `useMandarin` hook for state access.
- All navigation is now route-based, not state-based.
- JSDoc comments are added for documentation.
- The barrel file exports the new page using `export * from './FlashCardPage'`.

## Architecture Integration

- The page uses the `useMandarin` hook for state access.
- Integrated into the router configuration as a dedicated route.
- Navigation uses React Router (`useNavigate`).
- Page is documented with JSDoc comments.

## Technical Challenges & Solutions

**Challenge:** Migrating from state-based navigation to route-based navigation required refactoring component logic and updating references throughout the codebase.

**Solution:**

- Used React Router's `useNavigate` and `<Navigate />` for all navigation.
- Updated imports/exports to reflect new page locations.
- Deprecated legacy state-driven patterns.

## Testing Implementation

- Manual verification of navigation and functionality.
- Ensured identical behavior after refactoring.
- Unit tests should be added or updated to match the new implementation.
