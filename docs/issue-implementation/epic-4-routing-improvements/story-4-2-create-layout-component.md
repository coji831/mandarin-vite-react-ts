# Implementation 4-2: Create Layout Component with Outlet

## Technical Scope

Create a layout component with an outlet for the Mandarin feature to maintain consistent UI elements across all subpages. Move all old Mandarin feature components into the `/pages` directory and convert them into standalone subpages of the `/mandarin` routes, following the new nested routing structure.

## Implementation Details

- `MandarinLayout.tsx` is implemented in `src/features/mandarin/layouts/`.
- The layout includes the `MandarinProvider` and common UI elements (e.g., `Navbar`).
- Uses React Router's `Outlet` component to render nested routes.
- The router configuration is updated to use this layout for all Mandarin subpages.
- JSDoc comments are added for documentation.
- Unit test files should be created or updated to match the new implementation.

## Architecture Integration

- The layout wraps all Mandarin subpages and provides shared UI elements.
- Integrated into the router configuration as the parent for all Mandarin routes.

## Technical Challenges & Solutions

**Challenge:** Ensuring all shared UI and context logic is centralized in the layout and that all subpages render correctly as nested routes.

**Solution:**

- Used React Router's `Outlet` for nested routing.
- Centralized context and UI logic in the layout.

## Testing Implementation

- Manual verification of layout and navigation.
- Ensured identical behavior after refactoring.
- Unit tests should be added or updated to match the new implementation.
