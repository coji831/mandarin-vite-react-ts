# Implementation 4-7: Update Section/List Selection Navigation

## Technical Scope

Update navigation logic for vocabulary list and section selection to use React Router. All navigation in `VocabularyListPage`, `SectionSelectPage`, and `SectionConfirmPage` is now route-based using `useNavigate`. No remaining usages of state-based navigation for section/list selection. All navigation is compliant with the new routing structure.

## Implementation Details

- Navigation in `VocabularyListPage`, `SectionSelectPage`, and `SectionConfirmPage` is updated to use React Router's `useNavigate` instead of state changes.
- Callback props for navigation are replaced with direct navigation calls.
- All navigation is now route-based, not state-based.
- No remaining usages of state-based navigation for section/list selection.
- JSDoc comments are added for documentation.

## Architecture Integration

- Navigation logic is integrated into all relevant Mandarin subpages in `/pages`.
- Navigation uses React Router (`useNavigate`).

## Technical Challenges & Solutions

**Challenge:** Migrating from state-based navigation to route-based navigation required refactoring component logic and updating references throughout the codebase.

**Solution:**

- Used React Router's `useNavigate` and `<Navigate />` for all navigation.
- Updated imports/exports to reflect new page locations.
- Deprecated legacy state-driven patterns.

## Implementation Status

- **Status**: Completed
- **PR**: [Add PR number]
- **Merge Date**: [Add date]
- **Key Commit**: [Add commit hash] (Section/list navigation refactor)

## Testing Implementation

- Manual verification of navigation and functionality.
- Ensured identical behavior after refactoring.
- Unit tests should be added or updated to match the new implementation.
