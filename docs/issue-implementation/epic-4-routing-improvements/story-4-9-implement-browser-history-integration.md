# Implementation 4-9: Implement Browser History Integration

## Technical Scope

Implement proper browser history integration for improved navigation experience. Move all old Mandarin feature components into the `/pages` directory and convert them into standalone subpages of the `/mandarin` routes, following the new nested routing structure.

## Implementation Details

- Ensure browser back and forward buttons navigate correctly between routes.
- Add appropriate page titles for each route.
- Handle navigation when state is missing or invalid (e.g., route guards).
- Implement navigation confirmation for unsaved changes if applicable.
- All navigation is now route-based, not state-based.
- JSDoc comments are added for documentation.
- Unit test files should be created or updated to match the new implementation.

## Architecture Integration

- Browser history and route guards are integrated into all relevant Mandarin subpages in `/pages`.
- Navigation uses React Router (`useNavigate`).
- Route parameters and guards are handled in the relevant components.

## Technical Challenges & Solutions

**Challenge:** Ensuring robust browser navigation and handling edge cases for invalid navigation or missing state.

**Solution:**

- Used React Router's `useNavigate` and `<Navigate />` for all navigation.
- Added route guards and page title updates in relevant components.
- Deprecated legacy state-driven patterns.

## Testing Implementation

- Manual verification of browser navigation and edge cases.
- Ensured identical behavior after refactoring.
- Unit tests should be added or updated to match the new implementation.
